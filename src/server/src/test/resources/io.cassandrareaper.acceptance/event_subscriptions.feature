Feature: Manage diagnostic event subscriptions

  Scenario: Retrieving an empty subscriptions list
    Given that reaper   is running
    When a get all subscriptions request is made
    Then the returned list of subscriptions is empty

  Scenario: Retrieving an empty subscriptions list by existing cluster name
    Given that reaper   is running
    When a get-subscriptions request is made for cluster "test"
    Then the returned list of subscriptions is empty

  Scenario: Retrieve subscription for non existing cluster name
    Given that reaper   is running
    And the following subscriptions are created:
      | clusterName | description  | nodes       | events                                        | exportSse | exportFileLogger | exportHttpEndpoint |
      | test        | Test Cluster | 127.0.0.2   | AuditEvent,BootstrapEvent                     | true      |                  |                    |
    When a get-subscriptions request is made for cluster "test_cluster_non_existing"
    Then the returned list of subscriptions is empty

  Scenario: Retrieve subscriptions for existing cluster name
    Given that reaper   is running
    And the following subscriptions are created:
      | clusterName | description  | nodes       | events                                        | exportSse | exportFileLogger | exportHttpEndpoint |
